# odin-recipes

This is a basic HTML project that is a collection of delicious recipes. Currently the project contains three recipes and more can be added later on. I will also do the styling using CSS later on.

So far:

1. Created an index.html page.
2. Add three recipes in the recipes directory.
3. Each recipe contains a title, image, and decription (ingridients and steps)
4. Added a link to each recipe in the index.html page.
5. Also added link to index.html page in each individual recipe page. So, you can go back to index page from any of the recipe pages.

HTML Skills involved:

1. HTML boiler plate which is essential in getting started with HTML.
2. Heading tag with levels h1 to h6.
3. Image tag to add images to a webpage.
4. Unordered and Ordered lists.
5. anchor tag to add links to different pages, both within the website and from the web.

UPDATE:
1. Added a few bits of styling with CSS.
